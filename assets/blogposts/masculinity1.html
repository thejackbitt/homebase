              In the realm of masculinity, there is a burgeoning war between extremes.  The options young men have for role models are often relegated to toxic or spineless.  The self-styled “red pilled” influencers dominate the toxic end of the spectrum and the self-loathing incels inhabit the latter.  Even in popular media, it’s difficult to find a balanced male character.  Today, in the words of Bonnie Tyler, I will ask the question: “where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The beloved YouTube star MatPat, in his recent departure from content creation, had this to say about the state of masculinity:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>I want you to think about all the media that you consumed during your childhood.  All the TV shows and movies that you loved as a kid.  And now, with the perspective that you've gained as you've gotten older.  Can you name for me five good father figures from children's media?</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            He then goes on listing Bandit, Arthur Weasley, Uncle Iroh, Mufasa and Goofy as the only “good” male characters in children’s entertainment.  This thought-provoking video made me realize how ubiquitous this phenomenon is.  It is <i></i>very</i> hard to think of positive male role models in the current media landscape.  It even extends beyond movies and TV shows and onto the internet which is basically the replacement for legacy media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figures like Andrew Tate, Walter Weekes and Steven Crowder all stand out as relevant examples of toxic masculinity.  On the other side of the battleground of masculinity is BreadTubers.  This group is comprised of people like Vaush, EthanisOnline and Hasan Piker.  One side is against feminism to a misogynistic and the other side views itself as subservient to women rather than equals.  One side prioritizes strength above all else and the other values weakness.  How can both of these sides be so diametrically opposed and both be so wrong?  It’s because neither of them know what makes a man.  
          </p>
          <h2>
            Strength Under Restraint
          </h2>
          <p>
            When I was a kid, my heroes were Jake Justice, Batman and Han Solo.  Since I’ve grown up, I’ve added the Doom Slayer and the Mandalorian to that list.  The thing that I valued in each of these characters was not their strength nor their kindness or capacity of charity.  It was the restraint.  Batman prioritizing justice over vengeance by using non-lethal force is a classic example of strength.  He <i>could</i> beat someone to death or carry a firearm to execute violent felons on the spot but he doesn’t.  Instead, he uses martial arts and gadgets to subdue criminals and bring them to justice.  
          </p>
          <p>
            The same goes for one of my all-time favorites, the Doom Slayer.  In the 2016 reboot franchise, the Doom Slayer is depicted as a marine with superhuman strength and an incredible capacity for violence.  However, he demonstrates restraint as well.  In the Phobos Base level of Doom Eternal, Doomguy calmly walks through a facility of evil scientists who literally opened a portal to hell.  Instead of unleashing his anger on them, he reserves his strength for the demons to come.  
          </p>
          <p>
            This quality of restraint is absent in most heroes.  Arnold Schwarzenegger films are notorious for depicting men committing acts of unrestrained violence.  Many action movies from the 1990s depict macho men going from creating mounds of bodies to increasing a different sort of body count.  Pierce Brosnan’s James Bond is a classic example of this.  While many people still enjoy these womanizing action heroes, I think the majority of my readers would agree that James Bond goes well outside the bounds of propriety.  And that brings up another aspect of masculinity: chivalry.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Honorable Intentions
          </h2>
          <p>
            While many will be quick to point out that chivalry was actually just a set of combat rules for medieval knights, it has <i>traditionally</i> been understood to be the respectful treatment of others.  It seems that very few people understand this virtue.  As mentioned earlier, influencers like Steven Crowder are guilty of mistreating women.  At this point, everyone has seen the infamous “Ring footage” video of him verbally abusing his pregnant wife and subsequently hiring divorce attorneys behind her back.  This isn’t chivalrous behavior despite the values that he purported to espouse.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Male influencers on the other side of the spectrum are guilty of this as well albeit in a different way.  For example, the YouTuber Vaush is unashamedly addicted to pornography and has most recently been exposed for some borderline predatory behavior.  This revelation should not come as a shock to anyone given his public stance on porn.  Porn is exploitation whether it is self-inflicted (i.e. OnlyFans) or through sex trafficking.  The internet is forever and sexual consumption without love hurts everyone involved.  Any guy who views women (or other men) as sexual objects to such a degree as to publicly advocate their exploitation is no better than an abuser like Steven Crowder.
          </p>
          <p>
            For an excellent example of chivalry in media, look no further than Rick O’Connell from The Mummy franchise.  He’s a rugged individual yet he’s wholesome.  Rick, while not a perfect character, behaves in chivalrous fashion to the women in the story.  Not only does he practice strength under restraint, he takes care of his wife Evelyn and his son Alex.  
          </p>
          <h2>
            The Search for Masculinity
          </h2>
          <p>
            There is a reason all of these characters play so well with modern audiences.  There has been an entire internet phenomenon around men identifying with Batman or the Doom Slayer.  The Mandalorian charted 823M viewing minutes in the first week of Season 3’s premiere.  The Mummy made $416.4 million worldwide on its first movie alone to say nothing of the subsequent films or traffic to its themed ride at Universal.  
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this points to the fact that virtuous male characters are more appealing to general audiences than spineless, incompetent buffoons.  Take Poe Dameron from the recent Star Wars trilogy for example: when he isn’t being incessantly belittled by Admiral Holdo, he’s making tactical blunders and getting people killed.  It is as if the writers and directors despise this character and wish for him to fail.  Other examples of this type of character include Ken from Barbie or Maximus from the latest Fallout series.  Both of those characters are toxic men who are simultaneously incompetent.  
          </p>
          <p>
            While there may be a market for buffoons (The Simpsons just started Season 35), the largest demand is for wholesome male characters that boys can look up to.  With so many negative influences around us, men need good role models now more than ever.  It’s time for Hollywood to start reflecting that need.
