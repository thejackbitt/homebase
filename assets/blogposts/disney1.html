              It has often been said that “the best artists create for  their audience
              whereas others artists create for themselves.”  I’ve seen this quote be
              applied to many  different situations across the internet but the one I’m
              focusing on today is  the arguable king of the art media industry, Disney.
          </p>
          <p>
              From his work creating beautiful cartoons with engaging  characters to
              touching movies with aspirational heroes, Walt Disney inspired a  century of
              storytellers.  He created for  his audience and it proved to be massively
              successful.  The Disney Company used to stand for the  highest quality in
              animation and film.   As a kid with a stop-motion camera and some Lego
              people, I used to dream  about working for Disney someday.  The  Disney
              Company used to stand for the highest quality in animation and  film.  But
              that is no longer the  case.
          </p>
            <h2>
              The Box Office Flops
          </h2>
          <p>
              In the year of 2023, Disney released 12 major movies that all  had high
              hopes and an even higher budget.   These wishes, however, should have been
              made upon a different star.  The Walt Disney Company was strapping their
              hands,  arms, legs and feet inside the ride for a bumpy ride through this
              past year.
          </p>
          <p>
              For example, <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em> spent $193.2
              million and netted $81.9 million.  That  may seem like a lot of money but it
              is still 43% of its original budget.  In the end, they lost $111.3 million.
              This was one of the biggest losses to date  for the Walt Disney Companies.
              Later  that year, Disney released the 5 <sup>th</sup> installment in
              recently-acquired  the Indiana Jones franchise.
          </p>
          <p>
              Many Indiana Jones were stoked for this movie’s release.  The film, however,
              was a massive  disappointment.  With an impressive  budget of $294.7
              million, it returned only $174.4 million.  While still a better ROI than
              <em>Quantumania</em>,  60% is still a net loss.  The only thing  this film
              had it going for it as opposed to the aforementioned <em>Ant-Man</em> film
              was it’s relatively untarnished reputation.
          </p>
          <p>
              The Indiana Jones franchise has had more success with box  office audiences
              than the recent Marvel movies.   Speaking of Marvel, <em>The Marvels</em>
              was released last year with a  budget of $274.8 million and made $84.5
              million at the box office.  The 30% ROI was devastating to Disney and they
              needed to come up with something big, especially in lieu of the company’s
              100 <sup>th</sup> Anniversary.
          </p>
          <p>
              The answer to this problem came in the form of a strange  movie entitled
              <em>Wish</em>.  With an  estimated budget of $200 million, the movie
              generated $105.5 million in box  office revenue.  On top of the crushing 52%
              ROI, Disney battled accusations of using AI to write the script.  If you
              watch the movie and see how many  people were involved in the writing
              process, you’ll understand why these  speculations may prove credible.
          </p>
          <h2>
              What Happened?
          </h2>
          <p>
              The obvious question on everyone’s lips is “what  happened?”  How could such
              a beloved  production company fail so miserably at creating the art that
              their audience  enjoys?  The answer to this question lies  within marketing.
          </p>
          <p>
              It’s no secret that I am especially skeptical of marketing.  Throughout the
              last series of short  animations I created, the common thread was nefarious
              lies beneath a  family-friendly exterior.  I have this  perspective because
              I have worked in several different marketing positions  during my time as an
              intern, specialist and coordinator.  My reason for this skepticism is that
              modern  marketing as an art form has taken a wrong turn: marketers create
              for  themselves, not their audience.
          </p>
          <p>
              Before I get too far, I need to back up and introduce a marketing  concept
              that is critical to analyzing this problem with Disney.  That concept is
              personas.  A persona is a representation of the ideal  customer.  It usually
              comes in the form  of a document detailing the psychographic, geographic and
              demographic  characteristics of the target audience.   It also associates a
              name and a face to that group.  Essentially, it’s a made-up person that is
              supposedly representative of the customer base.   These personas can be
              useful but at the end of the day, they are still  made-up.
          </p>
          <p>
              It started as a tool for software developers (which is  coincidentally what
              I am doing now).  A  software developer in 1985 named Alan Cooper created
              personas as a means of  understanding the difficulties of customers to use
              his software.  He interviewed dozens of people and  consolidated them into
              one persona, a fictional character named “Kathy.”  This concept got popular
              with marketers in  the 1990s and has been used ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
              I, myself, have worked with personas a great deal.  At one company that I
              worked at I was asked  to present personas that someone else on my team
              created.  When I looked over them, I didn’t find them  to be very consistent
              with what customer data I could find at the time.  It was a masculine
              product with a masculine  audience and the persona was very feminine.   It
              seemed to be more of a reflection of the person who <em>created</em>the
              persona rather than the customer.
          </p>
          <h2>
              The Persona Problem
          </h2>
          <p>
              The problem that I noticed with these personas is that they  usually aren’t
              based in data.  Companies  that can’t afford the time to get to know their
              audience will invent imaginary  representations of their customers that
              don’t have anything to do with  reality.
          </p>
          <p>
              Based on what we’ve observed with Disney, it seems like they  are creating
              personas that represent the marketing team’s wishes rather than  the
              audience they are supposed to target.   This misalignment could be an
              explanation for what’s going wrong.  Going back to the Indiana Jones film, I
              can  safely say as a fan that what I wanted was a movie in which Indiana
              Jones was  an aspirational action hero just like he was in previous films.
              What I <em>didn’t</em> want was a movie in  which he is a loser upstaged by
              a female hero that hates him and everyone  likes.
          </p>
          <p>
              Disney used to stand for family animation and films that  were generally
              appealing, not hyper-niche.   If faulty personas are to blame for their
              recent track record, it would  make sense.  Content that appeals to only
              the marketing team is reflective of the mistakes many companies make with
              personas.  So here’s to Disney in  2024.  Let’s hope they get back to making
              art that their audience loves. <em></em>
